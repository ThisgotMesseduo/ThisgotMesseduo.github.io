<h3>This is a bit weird</h3>

<p>If I didn't leave this till last minute you would be reading this in a different way,</p>
<p>But you're reading this now so that's all that matters to me.</p>
<br>

<p>This got messed up</p>
<p>So messed up this website says "uo" instead of "up"</p>
<p>I came up with a more efficient way of getting this message out but this will have to do</p>
<br>

<h3>My message:</h3>
<p>School sounds like a great idea, when you're young you're forced to go to a place that teaches you a wide</p> 
<p>variety of skills so you don't have the same job your parents had. Sounds good right? Well about a hundred years ago - yes - but now, no, not</p>
<p>today. Not in a point in time where everyone knows how to read and is some what ok at math, not in a point in</p> 
<p>time where we have everything we will be taught at the tips of our fingertips. We can learn anything we want</p>
<p>whenever we want but for some reason we're forced to do it very slowly</p>
<p>Isn't this almost slowing us down as a society? If people were able to learn at their own rate lots of people could</p>
<p>move onto another topic and finish the subject faster. There is only one way of teaching and it only works well with a certain group of people because it was intended for a single group of people</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is school is flawed and outdated which I think is horrible</p>

<p><a href="changes.html">Here</a> is a list of things that should be changed in the Ontario education system</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind of how I sent this message</p>
