<p>1. Kids start school between the ages of 4 and 6</p>
<p>2. It is mandatory that kids between the ages of 4 and 12 go to school</p>
<p>3. The school day for students under 12 should start between 10:00 and 10:30 and end between 15:30 and 16:00</p>
<p>4. The school year for students under 12 should be from the middle of Feburary to November with a one month break in between</p>
<p>5. The school week should be Monday to Thursday</p>
<p>6. Every month students should be given a day off</p>
<p>7. The curriculum for students under 12 should teach: English (reading, writing, grammar), basic and some advanced math, an introduction to learning other Latin languages, basic science, basic history and geography, very basic ethics, philosophy, and logical thinking</p>
<p>This part is basically traditional teaching (what we have now)</p>
<br>

<p>This applies to students over the age of 12</p>
<p>8. Schools should be open 24/7</p>
<p>9. Schools will not recognize any statutory or religious holidays</p>
<p>10. After the age of 12 school becomes optional (almost)</p>
<p>11. School should be 100% asynchronous</p>
<p>12. All students are required to be in school for at least 500 hours</p>
<p>13. The school year starts on January 1st and ends December 31st</p>
<p>14. There is no standard curriculum, everything that anyone can learn at any age or level of education <i>needs</i> to be accessible to everyone</p>
<p>15. Throughout the school year students can change their subjects</p>
<p>16. "Educational assistants" should come in at least once a week to help students and give suggestions of what they should learn next</p>
<p>17. Students will have to take an "exam" near the end of the year - but they can take it at any time</p>
<p>18. This exam will be on everything the students learned</p>
<p>19. If a student fails the exam their answers and all the work they've done throughout the year needs to be reviewed by a human to determine whether they should pass or not</p>
<p>20. If a student wants to leave school they should be given certificate that has a list of everything they've done in school</p>
<p>21. There are no grades, there is only pass/fail</p>
<br>

<p>Please consider these changes and maybe actually start implementing them. These will probably make people actually enjoy going to school because they're not being forced to learn stuff they think is unnecessary, they can learn whatever they want whenever they want. People don't want to have to go to math class first thing in the morning, they're tired, and people don't want to go to math at the very end if the day because again they're tired. Why can't people just show up at literally anytime the day to do it?</p>
